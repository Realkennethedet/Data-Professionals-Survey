# Data-Professionals-Survey
Data professionals are in high demand and organizations are looking for ways to attract and retain top talents in the field. To better understand and preferences of data professionals, a survey was conducted and the results were analyzed using Power BI. The aim of this project is to present the key findings of the survey in an easy-to-understand visually compelling way.
#
Methodology: the survey data was cleaned using Power Query Editor and a Power BI dashboard was created to visualize the data. The dashboard includes various charts and graphs to illustrate the survey results such as salary distribution, work-life balance satisfaction and preferred programming languages.
#
Key Findings;
1.	A total of 630 data professionals participated in the survey, providing a significant sample size.
2.	Data professionals are satisfied with their work-life balance but they are not satisfied with their salaries.
3.	Data scientists earn higher salaries on average than data engineers, data analyst and other professionals in the field.
4.	Python is the most popular programming language among data professionals.
#
Recommendations:

Based on the survey findings, several recommendation can be made;
1.	Organizations should invest in training and resources for Python to meet the demand of data analysts, engineers, scientists and other professionals. Additionally, promoting the benefits and application of other popular programming languages like R and C++ can help professionals broaden their skill sets.
2.	To attract and retain top talents, organizations should offer competitive compensations packages and provide opportunities for career growth and development. Additionally, supporting students and entry level professionals with internships, scholarships and mentorship programs can help bridge the salary gap and encourage their career advancement.
